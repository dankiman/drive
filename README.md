# drive
Predict steering angle of a self driven car using behaviorial cloning 

# Data Collection
1. Data provided [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/December/584f6edd_data/data.zip) by udacity is used with real time augmetation. data folder contains the contents given below:
  1. `IMG` folder - this folder contains all the frames of your driving. 
  2. `driving_log.csv` - each row in this sheet correlates your image with the steering angle, throttle, brake, and speed of  your car. You'll mainly be using the steering angle.
2.`driving_log.csv` looks like
<img src="driving_log_snap.png" width="1512" alt="Combined Image" />
3. Alternatively data can be collected via training phase of simulator which needs careful driving because data should be balanced between proper driving as well as recovery from mistakes.
